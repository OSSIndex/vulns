# OSS Index Vulnerability Reporting

We are migrating to a new email-based reporting system in order to better mesh with our internal processes, which will allow us to be more reactive to our users.

To report an advisory missing from OSS Index, or a correction to an existing report, please email us at ossindex@sonatype.org
